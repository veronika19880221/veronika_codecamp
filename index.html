    <h1>Let the adventure begin!</h1>
    <p> Go hiking in Norway and discover why the locals canâ€™t get enough of nature. Our most scenic landscapes are definitely best enjoyed on foot.</p>
    <p> Phone off, out-of-office reply on. When it comes to long-distance hikes, you'd be hard-pressed to find a better country than Norway. With cozy, for-public-use cabins dotting the hills and a landscape that just won't quit, this could be the excuse you've been waiting for.</p>
